# go-hmos: experimental OpenHarmony Go

This fork adds an experimental OpenHarmony target to Go 1.27.
See [the port status and limitations](doc/openharmony.md).

## Quick installation

With Go 1.24.6+ and Git installed, build an isolated host toolchain with one command:

```text
go run github.com/ZxillyFork/go-hmos/gohmos@feature/openharmony-go1.27 install
```

The first install builds from pinned source and takes several minutes. There are
no prebuilt go-hmos releases yet. Your existing Go and PATH are unchanged.
See [the installer guide](gohmos/README.md) for Windows/macOS/Linux usage, upgrades,
reproducible commit-pinned installation, and the separate OpenHarmony SDK requirement.
